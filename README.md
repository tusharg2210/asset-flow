AssetFlow Backend

A scalable and modular backend service for the AssetFlow Asset Management System, built with Go (Golang) and PostgreSQL.

The application follows a clean, domain-driven architecture where each business module is organized into its own package with dedicated handler, service, and repository layers.

Architecture

The backend follows a layered architecture:

HTTP Request
      │
      ▼
 Handler
      │
      ▼
 Service
      │
      ▼
 Repository
      │
      ▼
 PostgreSQL

Handler

Responsible for:

- Parsing HTTP requests
- Input validation
- Calling business services
- Returning standardized JSON responses

Service

Responsible for:

- Business rules
- Validation
- Authorization logic
- Coordinating repositories

Repository

Responsible for:

- SQL queries
- Database transactions
- Data persistence

---

Handles:

- User Registration
- Login
- JWT Generation
- Password Hashing
- User Authentication

---

Organization

Handles:

- Departments
- Employees
- Employee Directory

---

Assets

---

Models

The "models" package contains the application's core domain entities that map directly to the PostgreSQL schema.

Examples include:

- User
- Asset
- Allocation
- Booking
- Maintenance
- Audit

Shared enums such as:

- User Roles
- Asset Status
- Booking Status

are defined in:

internal/models/enums.go

---

Middleware

Authentication Middleware

- JWT Verification
- Role Validation
- Protected Routes

Logger Middleware

- Request Logging
- Response Status
- Execution Time

---

Utilities

Common reusable utilities include:

- JWT helpers
- Password hashing
- Standard API responses

---

Database

Database configuration is managed inside:

internal/database/postgres.go

Database migrations are located in:

migrations/

Example:

000001_init_schema.up.sql
000001_init_schema.down.sql

---

Environment Variables

Create a ".env" file in the project root.

PORT=8080

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=assetflow
DB_SSLMODE=disable

JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key

---

Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/assetflow-backend.git

cd assetflow-backend

2. Install dependencies

go mod tidy

3. Configure environment

Create the ".env" file and update the database credentials.

4. Run database migrations

Apply the SQL migration files located in:

migrations/

using your preferred migration tool.

5. Run the application

go run cmd/server/main.go

The API will start on:

http://localhost:8080

---

API Design

The API follows RESTful conventions.

Example endpoints:

POST   /api/auth/login
POST   /api/auth/register

GET    /api/assets
POST   /api/assets

GET    /api/allocations
POST   /api/allocations

GET    /api/bookings
